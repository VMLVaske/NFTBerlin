# Bsquare

Bsquare for BuildersÂ  is a learn2earn platform to help web2 builders onboard web3.

What are we trying to solve?
onboard builders, developers from web2 to web3. From our experience with Coding Bootcamps, Blockchain Onboarding courses we know that many users drop out very quickly. To incentivise them we are looking at what helped us to stay motivated and pull through. The things we came up with, was repetition, study groups through which you learn different perspectives and which will encourage you to go on.

how do we solve this?

learn2earn concept. users join a cohort of x weeks. Every week they have to submit one written proof of learning, as well as one video of their learnings.

**How does it work?**

1. All users come to the platform and connect their wallet (Metamask, Near, Wallet Connect) to claim their membership NFT on polygon/near.
   Why choose polygon or near? Cheaper, Faster and sustainable.
2. At a bootcamp when a person uses the smart contract, they can decide the number of weeks (5,6) of the learning process. The learning progress is mapped using proof of homework. The user will be given a task every week.
3. What do they submit? Once the user completes the task, they will create a 1-3 minute long video using livepeer describing their takeaway from the lesson. They will submit this video on the platform using a link. Why livepeer?
4. Once approved, the proof of homework will be saved on arweave.
   How? The video will be sent through a bridge.
