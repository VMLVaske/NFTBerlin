## What are we trying to solve?

onboard builders, developers from web2 to web3. From our experience with Coding Bootcamps, Blockchain Onboarding courses we know that many users drop out very quickly. To incentivise them we are looking at what helped us to stay motivated and pull through. The things we came up with, was repetition, study groups through which you learn different perspectives and which will encourage you to go on.

## how do we solve this?

learn2earn concept. users join a cohort of x weeks. Every week they have to submit one written proof of learning, as well as one video of their learnings.

**How does it work?**

1. All users come to the platform and connect their Near wallet to claim their membership NFT on polygon/near. The membershipNFT will be stored on Arweave.
   Why choose polygon or near? Cheaper, Faster and sustainable.
2. The bootcamp that uses the application can choose the length in weeks. The learning progress is mapped using proof of reflection.
3. What do they submit? The user will be given a task every week and will have to reflect on their learnings in a 1-3 minute long video using livepeer describing their takeaway from the lesson. They will submit this video on the platform using a link. Why livepeer? amazing support, nice dashboard UI. Documentation can still be improved though :)
4. The video will first be stored locally for a review process (figure out validation process), the proof of reflection will be saved on arweave.
   How? The video will be sent through a bridge.
